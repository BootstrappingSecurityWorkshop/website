      You send five members of your technical team to our intense, single day workshop.  They learn how to select, prioritize, integrate, and maintain your company's security capabilities. They come back with a tailored roadmap to bake security into your product along with tools they need to meet and exceed the toughest security requirements.
        </div>
        <div className="text">
      After the workshop:
        <ul>
          <li>Your sales team handles customer security requirements internally - providing strong answers that give you a competitive advantage.</li>
          <li>Your engineers bake security and compliance requirements into their day-to-day operations - good security becomes the rule, not the exception.</li>
          <li>Your teams use security as a way to make your product and services more stable, robust and efficient - security is never a sunk-cost, it's a net positive. </li>
        </ul>
