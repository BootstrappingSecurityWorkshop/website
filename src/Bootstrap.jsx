        You can use your existing team to build security that enhances operations, increases your competitive edge and provides for a robust defense.
        Your company is filled with experts in your product's technologies - they're more than capable of securing those technologies.  What's missing is the strategy for prioritizing, integrating, maintaining your company's security capabilities.

      <div className="text">
        In this course, you send two technical team members to attend the training (one senior, one mid-junior level).  Those two people will become the core of your internal security effort.  They spend an intensive day learning startup security strategy and tactics and writing a go-forward security plan.  They return ready to build efficient, maintainable security inside your product and your company.
